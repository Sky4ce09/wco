## Info

All schematics will have (mostly) descriptive information on what components they require to function in their descriptions.

"Resource Outpost" refers to an available Resource Outpost Link that has been linked to a storage block.

Important info about Resource Outpost Link:

- must be linked to a storage block (core / container / router / whatever) to work -- you can link multiple of them to the same storage block
- will use a flare to communicate with a compatible schematic through unit flags, sharing the coordinates of the storage block and obtaining item demand info
